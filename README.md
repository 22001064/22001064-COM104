Will need to npm start for the frontend and python manage.py runserver for the backend

To have the login work you need to type 'cd frontend' and press enter and then type 'json-server --watch db.json --port 5000' and press enter 

Will also need to add:

Database schema and configuration scripts

API documentation and usage guide

Testing suite (Unit, Integration, End-to-End)

md with project overview, technologies used, setup instructions, and future improvements
